*rapid estimation of ion-pair dissociation constants*

### Description

*quick-fuoss* is an open-source Python 3 program designed to allow for quick estimation of ion-pair dissociation constants.
To run, *quick-fuoss* requires only the name of the cation and anion and the dielectric constant of the solvent in question.
Alternatively, `.xyz` files can be supplied.

*quick-fuoss* requires a working installation of [*cctk*](https://cctk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which does most of the heavy lifting.
